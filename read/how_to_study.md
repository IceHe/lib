# [How to Study: A Bried Guide](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html)

- 1\. "Studying" is not the same thing as "doing homework"!
- 2\. Manage Your Time
    - Priority: Your education should come first!
    - Not Study Enough？
        - Assume that your education is a full-time job, you should spend about 40 hours/week.
- 3\. Taking Notes in Class & Rewrite Them at Home
    - 3.2. Take Complete Notes
        - Reasons:
            - It will force you to pay attention to what’s going on in class.
            - It will keep you awake!
            - There will be less that you’ll have remember.
        - Should you concentrate on taking notes or understanding?
            - Prefer taking notes! (I’m surprised!)
            - Understanding can come later when you review your notes.
            - Incomplete notes will make it hard to learn what you didn’t take notes on.
    - 3.3. Use Abbreviations
        - Make it easy to take complete notes.
    - 3.4. Neatness Doesn’t Count
        - Be legible enough to be able to read your notes a few hours later.
        - Because you will rewrite notes in the evening or later.
    - 3.5. Ask Questions & Make Comments
        - Ask your question right now?
        - You’d better jot it or comment down in notes.
        - Because you won't forget it and can alway bring it up later.
    - 3.6. Copy Your Notes at Home
        - Just (re-)reading them is too passive, and won’t help.
        - Study you notes by re-writing them.
    - 3.7. Don’t Take Notes on a Computer
        - Typing might disturbing to your fellow students.
        - Have a firmer grashp of what I write if I handwrite it than I type it.
        - You can re-write notes on a computer so that you can easy to search them.
    - 3.8. Don’t Rely on the Instructor’s Lecture Notes
        - Just reading it is passive.
        - It’s beeter to re-writing them.
        - Or compare it with yours.
- 4\. Studying Hard Subjects First & Study in a Quiet Place
    - Do hard subjects first for which need you to be alert and energetic.
    - Quiet: Do not listen to music for you can’t "multitasking"!
    - When should you study?
        - As soon as possible and !
            - Make you have enough time to finish it.
            - You might have little time to play. Don’t complainn!
            - Take it serious! Assume that studying is a full time job!
- 5\. Read Texts Actively & Slowly, before & after Class
    - 5.1. Read Actively, Not Passively
        - Don’t read without thinking. Or you will fall asleep, ZZZ...
    - 5.2. Read Slowly
        - 「 An undeniable truth: that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower can be better. 」
        - An algorithm for how to read:
            - WHILE there is a next sentence to read, DO:
                - Read it, SLOWLY
                - IF you do not understand it, THEN:
                    - re-read the previous material, SLOWLY
                    - re-read the incommprehensible sentence, SLOWLY
                    - IF you still don’t understand it, THEN:
                        - ask a fellow student to explain it
                    - IF you still don’t understand it, THEN:
                        - ask your Teaching Assistant (TA) to explain it
                    - IF you still don’t understand it, THEN:
                        - Others
                    - IF you are in a upper-level course & still don’t understand it, THEN:
                        - write a paper about it (!)
        - Why use it?
            - It forces you to actively think about each sentence you read before you go on to the next on.
            - It slows you down, so that you don’t read past the point at which you don’t understand.
            - It can help you get help from your teacher, because you can show them where you get lost.
            - An opportunity to interact with your instructors and fellow students!
        - 「 How do you know whether you understand  what you’ve read? Easy: After each sentence, ask yourself "Why?" 」
    - 5.3. Highlight the Text in the Margin
        - Worst
            - Use a yellow marker (or any color you like).
            - You tend to find almost every sentence to be important or interesting.
            - So if everything has been highlighted, then really nothing has been!
                - Even destory your pages of your text.
            - It's also bad to use a pen or a pencil to underline.
        - Suggestion
            - Draw a __vertical line__ ']' in the margin.
                - So that you can re-read the text, highlight different passages each time.
                - e.g.
                ![](http://7vzp68.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/how_to_study/vertical_line_in_the_margin.jpg)
            - Or use __a pair of small square brackets__ in the text.
                - e.g. __[__ exactly where the highlighted passage begins or ends __]__
        - This way
            - Even if you've made a highlighting error, at least you haven't ruined the page.
            - Moreover, when re-reading, you can use another technique to highlight more important passages.
            - Or you will use double brackets in the margin for the second round of highlighting.
    - 5.4. Make Notes in the Margin
        - Put cross-references in the margin.
            - e.g., if a passage on p. 20 reminds me in some way of passage on p. 10, I'll write `see p. 20` in the margin of p. 20, and `see p. 10` in the margin of p. 10. Or put some keywords in the margin, if a passage reminds me of some major idea.
        - Make a index of my marginal comments, and add entries (e.g., Consciousness: 10, 20) to book's index
            - Or use a blank page at the end of the book if it doesn't have an index.
            - After a long time, you don't need to page through the book till you find something
    - 5.5. Keep a NoteBook
        - Disadvantages
            - Highlighting leads you to highlight everything.
            - Margins are often too small for making comments.
        - Best
            - A notebook with a full citation to the text for use in a bibligraphy.
            - Write down:
                - the page numbers of each message that you copy.
                - your comments on the passage at length and in detail.
            - Number you notes:
                - Number each notebook page with a Roman numberal (I, II, etc)
                - Number each quoted passage (or stand-alone comment) with an Arabic numeral (1, 2, etc.)
                - Letter (a, b, etc.) each comment associated with a quoted passage (or stand-alone comment)
                - Then you can refer to each passage with a identifer (like XIV-7-b, i.e., comments b about quotation 7, which comments is located on notebook page XIV)
    - 5.6. Read Literature Quickly and Passively the First Time.
        - An exception to this method of slow and active reading:
            - If the text is a work is a work of literature (a story, novel, play, poem, etc.),
            - it is often best to read it once all the way through without stopping, so that you get to know what it's about and can appreciated it.
        - What about film or video version of a work of literature?
            - No substitute for reading (The exception here is for plays).
            - If you do decide to watch in addition to read, which should you do first?
                - I prefer for watching first, reading afterwards.
                - Because I have always been disappointed by film adaptations of favourite texts (because they don't match the mental images that I construct when I read)
    - 5.7. Read Before and After Class
        - Read Twice
            - Read a text __before class__, perhaps quickly, so that you are familiar with its content.
            - Then (re-)read it __after class__ using the __slow and active method__.
        - If time permits, you can cut corners by only reading it - slowly and actively - after class.
- 6\. Do Your Homework
    - The reasons why are obvious.
    - Do them on scrap paper, check them over, and then copy them neatly.
        - In case the teacher loses it or doesn't give it back in time to use it for studying for an exam.
    - Don't just write down answers.
        - __Write down the problem__ and the complete solution __showing how you arrived at your answer__.
- 7\. Study for Exams
    - 7.1. Don't Study for Exams!
        - You should study "__for learning and understanding__"
        - But here are some suggestions if you want to study for exam.
    - 7.2. Manage Your Time
        - First Rule: __Don't Cram__
            - Begin studying about 1 week before the week.
            - Spend at least an hour each night (or day) studying for the exam in the manner described below.
            - Try to Spend the entire night (and/or day) before the exam studying for it.
            - If you have two exams on the same day, split the time in half.
