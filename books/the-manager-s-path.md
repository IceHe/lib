### What to Expect from a Manager

Everyone’s very first experience of management is on the other side of the table,
and the experience of being managed is the foundation on which you build your own management philosophy.

…

#### One-On-One Meetings

1-1s serve two purposes.

First, they create human connection between you and your manager.
_That doesn’t mean you spend the whole time talking about your hobbies or families or making small talk about the weekend._
But letting your manager into your life a little bit is important, because when there are stressful things happening
(a death in the family, a new child, a breakup, housing woes),
it will be much easier to ask your manager for time off or tell him what you need if he has context on you as a person.

…

The second purpose of a 1-1 is a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing.
_You should expect your 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability so that you can plan for them,_
_because it is not your manager’s job to completely control the 1-1 agenda._
_Sometimes he will, but it is good for you to put a little thought into what you might actually want to discuss before your 1-1 meetings._

…

#### Feedback and Workplace Guidance

You do want to get this feedback, though,
because the only thing worse than getting behavioral feedback is not getting it at all,
or getting it only during your performance review.
**The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct.**

_icehe : 明明是很浅显的道理, 很多人都明白, 却为什么常常都不这么做?_

_我觉得是因为 "志不在此" —— 生活重心不在工作上, 而是在爱好、处对象、养娃上;_
_工作主要只为赚钱, 没有成就动机, 平时当然不会为工作多费心思._

#### Training and Career Growth

…

### How to Be Managed

Part of being a good manager is figuring out how to be managed.

_This is not exactly the same as managing up ( 向上管理 ) , although it is related._
Developing a sense of **ownership and authority** _( 主人翁意识和权威 (技术声望) )_ for your own experiences at work,
and not relying on your manager to set the entire tone for your relationship,
is an important step in owning your career and workplace happiness.

#### Spending Time Thinking about What You Want
