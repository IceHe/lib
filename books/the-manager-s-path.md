### What to Expect from a Manager

Everyone's very first experience of management is on the other side of the table,
and the experience of being managed is the foundation on which you build your own management philosophy.

…

#### One-On-One Meetings

1-1s serve two purposes.

First, they create human connection between you and your manager.
_That doesn't mean you spend the whole time talking about your hobbies or families or making small talk about the weekend._
But letting your manager into your life a little bit is important, because when there are stressful things happening
(a death in the family, a new child, a breakup, housing woes),
it will be much easier to ask your manager for time off or tell him what you need if he has context on you as a person.

…

The second purpose of a 1-1 is a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing.
_You should expect your 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability so that you can plan for them,_
_because it is not your manager's job to completely control the 1-1 agenda._
_Sometimes he will, but it is good for you to put a little thought into what you might actually want to discuss before your 1-1 meetings._

…

#### Feedback and Workplace Guidance

You do want to get this feedback, though,
because the only thing worse than getting behavioral feedback is not getting it at all,
or getting it only during your performance review.
**The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct.**

_icehe : 明明是很浅显的道理, 很多人都明白, 却为什么常常都不这么做?_

_我觉得是因为 "志不在此" —— 生活重心不在工作上, 而是在爱好、处对象、养娃上;_
_工作主要只为赚钱, 没有成就动机, 平时当然不会为工作多费心思._

#### Training and Career Growth

…

### How to Be Managed

Part of being a good manager is figuring out how to be managed.

_This is not exactly the same as managing up ( 向上管理 ) , although it is related._
Developing a sense of **ownership and authority** _( 主人翁意识和权威 (技术声望) )_ for your own experiences at work,
and not relying on your manager to set the entire tone for your relationship,
is an important step in owning your career and workplace happiness.

#### Spending Time Thinking about What You Want

…

#### You Are Responsible For Yourself

**When that feedback comes to you, take it graciously, even when you don't agree with it.**

**When you are persistently unhappy, say something.**
**When you are stuck, ask for help.**
When you want a raise, ask for it.
**When you want a promotion, find out what you need to do to get it.**

**Your manager cannot force work–life balance on you.**
If you want to go home, figure out how to get your work done and go home.
**Sometimes you will have to go against the cultural grain to set your own boundaries**, and that will feel uncomfortable.
On the flip side, **sometimes if you want a bigger job, you will have to work more hours to get it.**

…

#### Give Your Manager A Break

…

Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems.

#### Choose Your Managers Wisely

Your manager can make a huge difference in your career.
So, as much as you can, consider not only the job, the company, and the pay,
but also the manager when you are evaluating job opportunities.

Strong managers know how to play the game at their company.
They can get you promoted;
they can get you attention and feedback from important people.

…

### Assessing Your Own Experience

## 2. Mentoring

### Being a Mentor

#### Mentoring an Intern

##### Listen Carefully

Listening is the first and most basic skill of managing people.
Listening is a precursor to empathy.

…

One of the early lessons in leadership,
whether it is via direct management or indirect influence,
is that people are **not good at saying precisely _( 恰好 )_**
**what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.**

_We have yet to achieve_
_[Borg hive mind](https://borgcollective.fandom.com/wiki/Hive_Mind) ( 蜂巢思维 )_
_or [Vulcan mind meld](https://intl.startrek.com/database_article/mind-meld-vulcan#:~:text=A%20touch%20technique%20that%20allows,the%20targeted%20partner's%20skull%20temples.),_
_so we're constantly pushing complex ideas through the eye of the needle of language._

**And language is not something that most engineers have mastered in nuance and interpretation.**
**So listening goes beyond hearing the words your mentee is saying.**
**When you're face to face with another person,**
**you also have to interpret his body language and the way he's saying those words.**
**Is he looking you in the eye? Is he smiling? Frowning? Sighing?**
**These small signals give you a clue as to whether he feels understood or not.**

**<u>Be prepared to say anything complex a few times, in different ways.</u>**
**If you feel that you don't understand something your mentee has asked you,**
**repeat the question in a different way.**
**Let him correct you.**

…

The odds of you spending all of your time answering questions are slim
compared to the odds that your intern will go off in the absolute wrong direction
because he didn't ask enough questions.

##### Clearly Communicate

With that said, what if the intern does spend too much time asking you for help,
without ever looking for help himself?

Well, that gives you an opportunity to work on another management skill:
**communicating what needs to happen**.
If you expect him to do research on his own before asking you a question, tell him so!

##### Clibrate Your Response

…

###### Mentroing a Summer Intern

_…_
_What should the intern do?_
_How do i prepare to help this person have a great summer?_
_…_
_Here are the basic things you need to do:_

1.  **Prepare for his arrival.**

    _Arrival date?_
    _Has a desk near you?_
    _Prepare computer?_
    _Prepare softwares?_
    …

2.  **Have a project for him to work on.**

    The trick to deciding on an intern project is that you want
    something **specific but not urgent**,
    something **relevant to the team**
    **but also something that could be completed**
    **by an entry-level engineer in the span of**, say,
    **half the time that your intern will be there**.

    This achieves two goals.
    **It gives him plenty of time,**
    **so if he has a lot of other activities to do,**
    such as going to training or social events set up by your internship program,
    he will still have time to complete it.

    _If he completes it before the end of the program, great ——_
    _he should hopefully know enough about some part of your code base_
    _to do other work for the rest of the time._

    _Remember, this person is an intern._
    _He's still in school and still learning,_
    _so expect him to move slowly,_
    _and be pleasantly surprised if he overshoots._

##### Mentoring a New Hire

…

How does work get done?
What are the rules, spoken and unspoken?

A more subtle unspoken rule dictates approximately
how long you are expected to struggle with something by yourself
before asking someone else to help you.

There are many bits of process, culture, and jargon that are so second-nature
that you might not realize they're completely foreign to a newcomer.

…

Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.

Things like step-by-step guides to setting up their development environments,
learning how tracking systems work,
and familiarizing themselves with the tools they will need for the job are crucial for new hires.

These documents should constantly evolve to meet the changes of the workplace itself.

…

Even if you have absolutely no interest in management,
it's very difficult to build a career at any company with multiple teams
without building a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas with.

…

##### Technical or Career Mentoring

###### When you are a mentor

**Tell your mentee what you expect from him.**

If you want him to come prepared for your meetings with questions he has sent you in advance, ask for that.
Be explicit about your time commitment.

And then be honest with him when he asks questions.
**There's no point in _( 没有意义 )_ being a mentor to a relative stranger**
**if you can't at least use that professional distance to offer him the kind of candid _( 耿直的, 直率的 )_ advice**
**that he may not get from his manager or coworkers.**

…

It’s also OK to say no to mentoring.
