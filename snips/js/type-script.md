## Intro

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language
which builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale.

What is TypeScript?

-   JavaScript and More

    TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript
    to support a tighter integration with your editor.
    Catch errors early in your editor.

-   A Result You Can Trust

    TypeScript code converts to JavaScript
    which runs anywhere JavaScript runs:
    In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

-   Safety at Scale

    TypeScript understands JavaScript and
    uses type inference to give you great tooling
    without additional code.
