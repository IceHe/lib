## Intro

Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications,
and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

-   **Seamless Java Interop**

    **Scala runs on the JVM**, so Java and Scala stacks can be freely mixed for totally seamless integration.

-   **Type Inference**

    So the type system doesn't feel so static.
    Don't work for the type system.
    Let the type system work for you!

-   **Concurrency & Distribution**

    Use data-parallel operations on collections, **use actors for concurrency and distribution**, or futures for asynchronous programming.

-   **Traits**

    Combine the flexibility of Java-style interfaces with the power of classes.
    Think **principled multiple-inheritance**.

-   **Pattern Matching**

    Think **"switch" on steroids**.
    **Match against class hierarchies, sequences, and more.**

-   **Higher-Order Functions**

    **Functions are first-class objects.**
    **Compose them with guaranteed type safety.**
    Use them anywhere, pass them to anything.
