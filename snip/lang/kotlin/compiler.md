# Compiler - Kotlin

## Install

### Homebrew

**Recommended**

```bash
brew update
brew install kotlin
```

### _SDKMAN!_

_Optional_

An easier way to install Kotlin on UNIX-based systems, such as OS X, Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, and Solaris, is [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/).
It also works in Bash and ZSH shells.

- [Learn how to install SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/install). e.g.:

    ```bash
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    ```

To install the Kotlin compiler via SDKMAN!, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sdk install kotlin
```
