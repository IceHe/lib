## Intro

**The [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) class is a crucial component of an Android app, and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental part of the platform's application model.**
****Unlike programming paradigms in which apps are launched with a `main()` method, the Android system initiates code in an `Activity` instance by invoking specific callback methods that correspond to specific stages of its lifecycle.**
