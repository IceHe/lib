## Intro

**The [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) class is a crucial component of an Android app, and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental part of the platform's application model.**
****Unlike programming paradigms in which apps are launched with a `main()` method, the Android system initiates code in an `Activity` instance by invoking specific callback methods that correspond to specific stages of its lifecycle.**

This document introduces the concept of activities, and then provides some lightweight guidance about how to work with them. For additional information about best practices in architecting your app, see Guide to App Architecture.
