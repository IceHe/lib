Terminology

-   **CL**: Stands for “**changelist**”,
    which means one self-contained change that has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.

    Other organizations often call this a “change”, “patch”, or “pull-request”.

-   **LGTM**: Means “**Looks Good to Me**”.

    It is what a code reviewer says when approving a CL.
