## Terminology

-   **[OpenID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Foundation)**

    an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation.

    It allows users to be authenticated by cooperating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party identity provider (IDP) service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems, and allowing users to log into multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each.
