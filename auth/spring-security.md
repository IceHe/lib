## Authentication and Access Control

Application security boils down to two more or less independent problems:

-   **authentication (who are you?)** and
-   **authorization (what are you allowed to do?)**.

Sometimes people say “**access control**” instead of "authorization", which can get confusing, but it can be helpful to think of it that way because “authorization” is overloaded in other places.

Spring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies and extension points for both.
