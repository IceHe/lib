## Description

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.
**It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.**

It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases.
Most commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.
