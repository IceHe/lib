Functions are the basic building block of any application, whether they're local functions, imported from another module, or methods on a class.
**They're also values, and just like other values, TypeScript has many ways to describe how functions can be called.**

---

## Function Type Expressions

_The simplest way to describe a function is with a function type expression._
_These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions:_

```ts
function greeter(fn: (a: string) => void) {
  fn("Hello, World");
}

function printToConsole(s: string) {
  console.log(s);
}

greeter(printToConsole);
```

The syntax `(a: string) => void` means "a function with one parameter, named `a`, of type string, that doesn't have a return value".
_Just like with function declarations, if a parameter type isn't specified, it's implicitly `any`._

_Of course, we can use a type alias to name a function type:_

```ts
type GreetFunction = (a: string) => void;
function greeter(fn: GreetFunction) {
  // ...
}
```

## Call Signatures

In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable.
However, the function type expression syntax doesn't allow for declaring properties.
**If we want to describe something callable with properties, we can write a call signature in an object type**:

```ts
type DescribableFunction = {
  description: string;
  (someArg: number): boolean;
};

function doSomething(fn: DescribableFunction) {
  console.log(fn.description + " returned " + fn(6));
}
```

Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.

## Construct Signatures

**JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new` operator.**
TypeScript refers to these as _constructors_ because they usually create a new object.
You can write a construct signature by adding the `new` keyword in front of a call signature:

```ts
type SomeConstructor = {
  new (s: string): SomeObject;
};

function fn(ctor: SomeConstructor) {
  return new ctor("hello");
}
```

**Some objects, like JavaScript's `Date` object, can be called with or without new.**
You can combine call and construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:

```ts
interface CallOrConstruct {
  new (s: string): Date;
  (n?: number): number;
}
```

## Generic Functions

_It's common to write a function where the types of the input relate to the type of the output, or where the types of two inputs are related in some way._
_Let's consider for a moment a function that returns the first element of an array:_

```ts
function firstElement(arr: any[]) {
  return arr[0];
}
```

_This function does its job, but unfortunately has the return type `any`._
_It'd be better if the function returned the type of the array element._

**In TypeScript, _generics_ are used when we want to describe a correspondence between two values.**
We do this by declaring a _type parameter_ in the function signature:

```ts
function firstElement<Type>(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined {
  return arr[0];
}
```

**By adding a type parameter `Type` to this function and using it in two places, we've created a link between the input of the function (the array) and the output (the return value).**
Now when we call it, a more specific type comes out:

```ts
// s is of type 'string'
const s = firstElement(["a", "b", "c"]);
// n is of type 'number'
const n = firstElement([1, 2, 3]);
// u is of type undefined
const u = firstElement([]);
```

### Inference

_Note that we didn't have to specify `Type` in this sample._
_The type was **inferred** - chosen automatically - by TypeScript._

_We can use multiple type parameters as well._
_For example, a standalone version of map would look like this:_

```ts
function map<Input, Output>(arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[] {
  return arr.map(func);
}

// Parameter 'n' is of type 'string'
// 'parsed' is of type 'number[]'
const parsed = map(["1", "2", "3"], (n) => parseInt(n));
```

Note that in this example, TypeScript could infer both the type of the `Input` type parameter (from the given `string` array), as well as the `Output` type parameter based on the return value of the function expression (`number`).

### Constraints

_We've written some generic functions that can work on `any` kind of value._
_Sometimes we want to relate two values, but can only operate on a certain subset of values._
_In this case, we can use a constraint to limit the kinds of types that a type parameter can accept._

_Let's write a function that returns the longer of two values._
_To do this, we need a `length` property that's a `number`._
We **constrain the type parameter to that type by writing an `extends` clause**:

```ts
function longest<Type extends { length: number }>(a: Type, b: Type) {
  if (a.length >= b.length) {
    return a;
  } else {
    return b;
  }
}

// longerArray is of type 'number[]'
const longerArray = longest([1, 2], [1, 2, 3]);
// longerString is of type 'alice' | 'bob'
const longerString = longest("alice", "bob");
// Error! Numbers don't have a 'length' property
const notOK = longest(10, 100);
// Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ length: number; }'.
```

_There are few interesting things to note in this example._
_We allowed TypeScript to infer the return type of `longest`._
**Return type inference also works on generic functions.**

Because we constrained `Type` to `{ length: number }`, we were allowed to access the `.length` property of the `a` and `b` parameters.
Without the type constraint, we wouldn't be able to access those properties because the values might have been some other type without a length property.

_The types of `longerArray` and `longerString` were inferred based on the arguments._
_Remember, generics are all about relating two or more values with the same type!_

_Finally, just as we'd like, the call to `longest(10, 100)` is rejected because the number type doesn't have a `.length` property._

### Working with Constrained Values

_Here's a common error when working with generic constraints:_

```ts
function minimumLength<Type extends { length: number }>(
  obj: Type,
  minimum: number
): Type {
  if (obj.length >= minimum) {
    return obj;
  } else {
    return { length: minimum };
    // Type '{ length: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Type'.
    //   '{ length: number; }' is assignable to the constraint of type 'Type', but 'Type' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{ length: number; }'.
  }
}
```

It might look like this function is OK - `Type` is constrained to `{ length: number }`, and the function either returns `Type` or a value matching that constraint.
The problem is that the function promises to return the same kind of object as was passed in, not just some object matching the constraint.
If this code were legal, you could write code that definitely wouldnâ€™t work:
