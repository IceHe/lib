Functions are the basic building block of any application, whether they're local functions, imported from another module, or methods on a class.
**They're also values, and just like other values, TypeScript has many ways to describe how functions can be called.**

---

## Function Type Expressions

_The simplest way to describe a function is with a function type expression._
_These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions:_

```ts
function greeter(fn: (a: string) => void) {
  fn("Hello, World");
}

function printToConsole(s: string) {
  console.log(s);
}

greeter(printToConsole);
```

The syntax `(a: string) => void` means "a function with one parameter, named `a`, of type string, that doesn't have a return value".
_Just like with function declarations, if a parameter type isn't specified, it's implicitly `any`._

_Of course, we can use a type alias to name a function type:_

```ts
type GreetFunction = (a: string) => void;
function greeter(fn: GreetFunction) {
  // ...
}
```

## Call Signatures

In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable.
However, the function type expression syntax doesn't allow for declaring properties.
**If we want to describe something callable with properties, we can write a call signature in an object type**:

```ts
type DescribableFunction = {
  description: string;
  (someArg: number): boolean;
};

function doSomething(fn: DescribableFunction) {
  console.log(fn.description + " returned " + fn(6));
}
```

Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.

## Construct Signatures

**JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new` operator.**
TypeScript refers to these as _constructors_ because they usually create a new object.
You can write a construct signature by adding the `new` keyword in front of a call signature:

```ts
type SomeConstructor = {
  new (s: string): SomeObject;
};

function fn(ctor: SomeConstructor) {
  return new ctor("hello");
}
```

**Some objects, like JavaScript's `Date` object, can be called with or without new.**
You can combine call and construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:

```ts
interface CallOrConstruct {
  new (s: string): Date;
  (n?: number): number;
}
```

## Generic Functions

It's common to write a function where the types of the input relate to the type of the output, or where the types of two inputs are related in some way.
Letâ€™s consider for a moment a function that returns the first element of an array:
