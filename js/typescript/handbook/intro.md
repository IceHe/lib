## About this Handbook

……

The goal of TypeScript is to be a **static typechecker for JavaScript programs** - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).

……

## How is this Handbook Structured

The handbook is split into two sections:

-   The Handbook

    ……
    In the interests of clarity and brevity <!-- 简洁, 简短 -->, the main content of the Handbook will not explore every edge case or minutiae of the features being covered.
    ……

-   Reference Files

    The reference section below the handbook in the navigation is built to provide a richer understanding of how a particular part of TypeScript works.

    You can read it top-to-bottom, but each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.
