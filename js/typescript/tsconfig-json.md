## Overview

**The presence of a `tsconfig.json` file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project.**
**The `tsconfig.json` file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.**

_A project is compiled in one of the following ways:_

## Using `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`

- By invoking tsc with no input files, in which case the compiler searches for the `tsconfig.json` file starting in the current directory and continuing up the parent directory chain.
- By invoking tsc with no input files and a `--project` (or just `-p`) command line option that specifies the path of a directory containing a `tsconfig.json` file, or a path to a valid `.json` file containing the configurations.

When input files are specified on the command line, `tsconfig.json` files are ignored.
